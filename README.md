### Tech Stack
* React
* Jest
* SCSS
* Router
* Bootstrap

### Overview
This is a movie review site where users can see newly released movies and click to see more details. 

### Learning Goals
* Learn React Testing
* Create multi-page UX using Router

### Functionality 
**Main page**
When a user loads the page a carousel of three random movies is displayed at the top of the page. Below this users will find all movie posters displayed along with their name and rating. 

**Movie details view** 
Once a user clicks on a movie poster they are redirected to a details page. In this view the revenue, budget, genres, an overview and a movie trailer for the selected movie are all shown. To return back to the main view a user can click the home button or on the TMDB icon. 

**Search**
A user has the option to search for a movie tile which will lead to a new search results page. From this view they will be presented with a list of movie titles that match their search where they can click into each to see more details. 

### Wins
* Users are able to type in a URL including the movie id and be routed to that specific movie
* We completed the extenshion to add a search bar
* We have 74.83% test coverage

### Challanges
* Bootstap did not always play well with React
* Async nature testing in React
